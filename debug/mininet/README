Introduction
===============
This is a simple example of how to use mcproxy within mininet (mininet.org) 

The topologie discribed by the file mininet.py looks like this:   
                  
                       +-----------+
                       |           |
                       |   #LMA#   |
                       |  (table 1)|
                       +-----------+
                lma-eth0 /       \ lma-eth1         
                       /           \        
                     /               \      
                   /                   \    
                 /                       \  
               /                           \
   mag1-eth0 /                               \ mag2-eth0
       +-----------+                   +-----------+
       |           |                   |           |
       |  #MAG1#   |                   |  #MAG2#   |
       |  (table 2)|                   |  (table 3)|
       +-----------+                   +-----------+
   mag1-eth1 |                               | mag2-eth1 
             |                               | 
             |                               | 
             |                               | 
  host1-eth0 |                               | host2-eth0 
       +-----------+                   +-----------+
       |           |                   |           |
       |  #Host1#  |                   |  #Host2#  |
       |   (sender)|                   | (receiver)|
       +-----------+                   +-----------+
          
For the boxes LMA, MAG1, and MAG2 is a proxy instance started. The behaviour of
every instance are described in configuration files lma.conf, mag1.conf, mag2.conf. The Host1 sends group packages of the group 239.99.99.99 to the interface host1-eth0 and Host2 receives hopefully these packages on inteface host2-eth0. The exact behaviours of the hosts are described in the file tester.ini.
     
Requirements
------------
You have to install mininet, which can usually be done with the following comand:
    sudo apt-get install mininet
    
You have to compile the mcproxy and the mcproxy tester (see chapter mcproxy tester in ../README).

Usage   
-----   
    sudo su
    mn -c
    python2 mininet.py
