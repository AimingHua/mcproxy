#Naming and definitions
sX:          is a specific multicast source (where X could be 1 or 2 or ...)
S:           is a list of multicast sources (sX) 
Sg:          is a multicast source list with the group membership mode INCLUDE or EXCLUDE 
Sf:          is a multicast source list with with the inteface filter mode WHITELIST or BLACKLIST 
IN(S):       is a source list Sg in group membership mode INCLUDE
EX(S):       is a source list Sg in group membership mode EXCLUDE
WL(S):       is a source list Sf in in interface filter mode WHITELIST
BL(S):       is a source list Sf in interface filter mode BLACKLIST 
P:           is the position UPSTREAM or DOWNSTREAM of an interface 
I(P,Sg,Sf):  is an interfaces with a Position and and two source lists. One with a specific group membership mode and one an interface filter mode. 
D(Sg,Sf):    is an interface with a DOWNSTREAM Position 
U(Sg,Sf):    is an interface with an UPSTREAM Position
Dm(Sg):      is a DOWNSTREAM interface with merged list Sg and Sf              
Dmall(Sg):   represents all merged DOWNSTREAM interfaces Dm(Sg) 
Um(Dmall)    is an UPSTREAM interface with merged Dmall(Sg) and Sf
R(Sg):       is the remainder of a merge operation
